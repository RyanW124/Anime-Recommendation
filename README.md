# Anime Recommendation

This project uses the MyAnimeList API and matrix factorization to recommend animes.
The program goes through your top animes and adds users who share similar watch history to the user-item matrix.

## How to use
1. Get an access token to [MAL API](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/authorization) with the help of *get_token.py*
2. Run *main.py*
